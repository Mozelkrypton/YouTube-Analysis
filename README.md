# Social Media Data Analysis Using WEKA

## Project Overview
This project analyzes large volumes of social media data from platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using WEKA. The goal is to identify patterns that can be leveraged to influence public opinion in favor of a political candidate during an election campaign.

## Objective
- Utilize data mining techniques in WEKA to extract meaningful insights from social media interactions.
- Perform association mining and cluster analysis to uncover patterns in sentiment, user engagement, and demographics.
- Develop strategies for targeted messaging and content creation based on the results.

## Tools & Technologies
- **WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)**: Used for data preprocessing, association rule mining, and clustering.
- **CSV Files**: Used for data storage and input into WEKA.
- **Python (optional)**: Can be used for additional data preprocessing.

## Steps Involved
### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gather data from social media platforms, including posts, comments, likes, shares, sentiment scores, and metadata.
- Clean the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and saving in CSV format.

### 2. Preparing Data for WEKA
- Ensure CSV files are formatted correctly, with proper headers and attribute selection.
- Choose relevant attributes such as `TextContent`, `SentimentScore`, `Likes`, `Shares`, `Timestamp`, and `UserDemographics`.

### 3. Loading Data into WEKA
- Open WEKA and use the "Explorer" interface.
- Load the CSV files into WEKA for further processing.

### 4. Association Mining
- Navigate to the "Associate" tab in WEKA.
- Choose an association rule learning algorithm, such as Apriori.
- Configure parameters like minimum support and confidence.
- Analyze generated association rules to identify frequent patterns and relationships in user interactions.

### 5. Cluster Analysis
- Navigate to the "Cluster" tab in WEKA.
- Select a clustering algorithm such as K-Means or Expectation-Maximization (EM).
- Set cluster parameters and execute the algorithm.
- Analyze clusters to segment users based on engagement, sentiment, and demographics.
